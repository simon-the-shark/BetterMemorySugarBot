# How does it work?
 1. every day at given time - atrigger.com automatically triggers your website
 2.  BetterMemorySugarBot automatically reads last change data from your [nightscout](https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor) website
 3. BetterMemorySugarBot calculates your next change date
 4.  BetterMemorySugarBot notifies you via IFTTT or SMS about remaing hours to approaching change. Read more about notifications [here](#notifications)

# Notifications
**BetterMemorySugarBot** has two ways of notifying. I recomend notifying via **IFTTT**. It`s completly free, easier to set up and it is flexible. You can choose notifying via **facebook messenger**, **push notifications** from mobile app or **email**. Of course, you can explore this platform and combine BetterMemorySugarBot with other services on your own.Second options is **SMS via Twilio API**. I have to warn you, that **when free credits are run out, you will have to pay for text messages**. To use your free credits you do not have to give them any credit card or any other billing info. It is also a little more complicated to configurate than IFTTT. If you had decided, you can go to [notifications configuration instruction](#notifications-configuration-instructions)

### Notifications configuration instruction
1. [Log in to your website](#logging-in-to-your-website) and go to notifications center.
![doc26](/readme-images/doc26.png)
3.  Choose your notifications way (you can choose both) and click `CHANGE` button. (picture below)
![doc27](/readme-images/doc27.png)
4. Now go to [IFTTT configuration](#ifttt-configuration) or to [SMS configuration](#sms-configuration)


### IFTTT configuration
1. If you are here, I assume you had already followed [notifications configuration instruction](#notifications-configuration-instructions)
2. Create account on IFTTT or if you already done this, you can [log in](https://ifttt.com/login?wp_=1)
   * Go to [this link](https://ifttt.com)
   * You can sign up with your social media account or just type your email and click `Get started` button.
   * If you had choose email registration, now type your password and click `Sign up` button.
3. Now go to [this link](https://ifttt.com/services/maker_webhooks)
4. Click `Connect` button (picture below)

11. Of course, you can add more IFTTT accounts and BetterMemorySugarBot will trigger all of them.
12. Finally, time for creating your own notifying applet:
    * [Facebook Messenger notifications](#facebook-messenger)
    * [push notifications](#push-notifications) from IFTTT mobile app
    * [email](#email-notifications)
